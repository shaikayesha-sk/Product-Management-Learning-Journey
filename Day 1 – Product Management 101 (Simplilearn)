🎯 What I Learned on Day 1
1. Understanding Product Management

Product Management is the practice of identifying user problems and delivering solutions that align with business objectives. It combines strategic thinking, technical understanding, and user empathy to ensure that the right product is built and continuously improved.

A Product Manager is responsible for defining what to build and why it should be built, while collaborating closely with engineering, design, marketing, and business stakeholders.

2. Role of a Product Manager

From this module, I understood that a Product Manager:

Acts as the central point of communication between stakeholders

Translates business goals into product requirements

Prioritizes features based on impact, feasibility, and user value

Ensures the product delivers measurable outcomes

The role is not limited to execution but involves continuous decision-making using data, feedback, and market insights.

3. Product Manager Roadmap

I learned that a product roadmap is a strategic document that outlines:

Product vision and long-term goals

Feature priorities and timelines

Alignment between business strategy and development efforts

Roadmaps help teams stay focused, manage expectations, and adapt to changes based on user feedback and performance metrics.

Project Management (Jira): Manage tasks, sprints, and issue tracking

Team Collaboration (Trello): Coordinate work across teams

Each tool supports informed decision-making and efficient collaboration.
