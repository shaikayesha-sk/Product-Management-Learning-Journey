# Product-Management-Learning-Journey
This repository documents my structured learning journey in Product Management, starting from foundational concepts and gradually progressing toward advanced product thinking and execution. The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate continuous learning, practical understanding, and a clear transition toward a product-focused career.

The content is based on formal coursework, self-study, and applied understanding, with an emphasis on user-centric thinking, data-driven decision-making, and real-world product workflows.
